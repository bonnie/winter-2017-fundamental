    **Subject:** *URGENT* Testing not working!!!!

    Hey there,

    Some engineers recently left to join (the-company-that-
    shall-not-be-named), but they seem to have sabotaged some of the tests
    before they left. Please fix the tests so they represent the true spirit
    of Ubermelon again. 

    Thanks,
    Mel
    Team Lead


**To Do:**

- Download material.

- Run `python melon_tests.py` to see where the errors in the tests are.

- Fix the errors in the tests.

**Note:** You can assume the errors are all in the tests in this case, and 
not in the code.
